\title{Package R.matlab}


\description{
  Methods readMat() and writeMat() for reading and writing MAT files.  For user with MATLAB v6 or newer installed (either locally or on a remote host), the package also provides methods for controlling MATLAB (trademark) via R and sending and retrieving data between R and MATLAB.

  In brief, this package provides a one-directional interface from
  \R to MATLAB, with communication taking place via a TCP/IP connection
  and with data transferred either through another connection or via
  the file system. On the MATLAB side, the TCP/IP connection is handled
  by a small Java add-on.

  The methods for reading and writing MAT files are stable.
  The \R to MATLAB interface, that is the Matlab class, is less
  prioritized and should be considered a beta version.

  For package history, see \code{showHistory(R.matlab)}.
}

\section{Requirements}{
  This is a cross-platform package implemented in plain \R.
  This package depends on the \pkg{R.oo} package [1].

  To use the Matlab class or requesting verbose output messages, the
  \link[R.utils:R.utils-package]{R.utils} package is loaded
  when needed (and therefore required in those cases).

  The \code{readMat()} and \code{writeMat()} methods do \eqn{not}
  require a MATLAB installation neither do they depend on the
  \code{\link{Matlab}} class.

  To connect to MATLAB, MATLAB v6 or higher is required.
  It does \emph{not} work with MATLAB v5 or before (because those
  versions do not support Java).
  For confirmed MATLAB versions, see the \code{\link{Matlab}} class.
}

\section{Installation}{
  To install this package do\cr

  \code{install.packages("R.matlab")}
}

\section{To get started}{
  To get started, see:
  \enumerate{
    \item \code{\link{readMat}}() and \code{\link{writeMat}}() - For reading and writing
          MAT files (MATLAB is \emph{not} needed).
    \item \code{\link{Matlab}} - To start MATLAB and communicate with it from \R.
  }
}

\section{Miscellaneous}{
  A related initiative is \emph{RMatlab} by Duncan Temple Lang
  and Omegahat.  It provides a bi-directional interface between the
  \R and MATLAB languages. For more details, see
  \url{http://www.omegahat.net/RMatlab/}.
  To call R from MATLAB on Windows (only), see \emph{MATLAB R-link}
  by Robert Henson available at the MATLAB Central File Exchange
  (\url{http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=5051}).

\section{Troubleshooting}{
  \bold{In general}:\cr
  For trouble shooting in general, rerun erroneous function with
  verbose/debug messages turned on. For \code{readMat()} and \code{writeMat()}
  see their help. For communication with a MATLAB server, use
  \preformatted{
   matlab <- Matlab()
   setVerbose(matlab, threshold = -2)
  }
  The lower the threshold is the more information you will see.\cr

  \bold{Cannot connect to MATLAB}:\cr
  If R fails to connect to MATLAB, make sure to try the example in
  help(Matlab) first.  Make sure that the MATLAB server is running
  before trying to connect to it from R first.  If MATLAB is running
  but \code{open()} times out, make sure MATLAB is listening to the
  same port that R is trying to connect to.  If that does not help,
  try to increase the time-out limit, see help(open.Matlab).\cr

  \bold{Expected an 'answer' from MATLAB, but kept receiving nothing.}:\cr
    When launching a really long MATLAB process by \code{evaluate()}, you
  may get the above error message.\cr
  \emph{Reason:} This happens because \code{evaluate()} expect a reply
  from MATLAB as soon as MATLAB is done. The waiting should be "blocked",
  i.e. it should wait until it receives something. For unknown reasons,
  this is not always happening. The workaround we have implemented is to
  try \code{readResult/maxTries} waiting \code{readResult/interval} seconds
  inbetween.\cr
  \emph{Solution:}
  Increase the total waiting time by setting the above options, e.g.
  \preformatted{
   setOption(matlab, "readResult/interval", 10)     # Default is 1 second
   setOption(matlab, "readResult/maxTries", 30 * (60 / 10)) # ~30 minutes
  }
}

\section{Wishlist}{
 Here is a list of features that would be useful, but which I have
 too little time to add myself. Contributions are appreciated.
 \itemize{
   \item Add a function, say, \code{Matlab$createShortcut()} which
         creates a Windows shortcut to start the MATLAB server
         by double clicking it. It should be possible to create
         it in the current directory or to the Desktop.
         Maybe it is possible to do this upon installation and
         even to a Start -> All Programs -> R menu.
   \item To improve security, update the MatlabServer.m script to
         allow the user to specify a "password" to be send upon
         connection from R in order for MATLAB to accept the
         connection. This password should be possible to specify
         from the command line when starting MATLAB. If not given,
         no password is required.
   \item Add additional methods to the Matlab class. For instance,
         inline function in MATLAB could have its own method.
   \item Wrap up common MATLAB commands as methods of the Matlab
         class, e.g. \code{who(matlab)}, \code{clear(matlab)} etc.
         Can this be done automatically using "reflection", so
         that required arguments are automatically detected?
   \item Add access to MATLAB variables via \code{"$"} and
         \code{"$<-"}, e.g. \code{matlab$A} and
         \code{matlab$A <- 1234}. Is this wanted?
         Maybe the same for functions, e.g. \code{matlab$dice(1000)}.
         Is it possible to return multiple return values?
 }

 If you consider implement some of the above, make sure it is not
 already implemented by downloading the latest "devel" version!
