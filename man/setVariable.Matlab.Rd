\title{Sets one or several MATLAB variables}

\description{
  Sets one or several \R variables on the MATLAB server.
  The transfer of the data can be done locally via a temporary file
  (\code{remote = FALSE}) or through the socket \code{\link[base:connections]{connection}} (\code{remote = TRUE}),
  which is always available.
}

\usage{
\method{setVariable}{Matlab}(this, ..., remote=this$remote)
}

\arguments{
  \item{...}{Named \R variables to be set in MATLAB.}
  \item{remote}{If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}} the variables are transferred on the
    socket \code{\link[base:connections]{connection}}, otherwise they are transferred via a temporary file.}
}

\value{
  Returns nothing. If the MATLAB server did not received the variables
  successfully an exception is thrown.
