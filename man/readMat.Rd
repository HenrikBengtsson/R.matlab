\title{Reads a MAT file structure from a connection or a file}

\description{
 Reads a MAT file structure from a connection or a file.
 Both the MAT version 4 and MAT version 5 file formats are
 supported. The implementation is based on [1-5].
 Note: Do not mix up version numbers for the MATLAB software and
 the MATLAB file formats.
}

\usage{
\method{readMat}{default}(con, maxLength=NULL, fixNames=TRUE, drop=c("singletonLists"),
  sparseMatrixClass=c("Matrix", "SparseM", "matrix"), verbose=FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{con}{Binary \code{\link[base:connections]{connection}} from which the MAT file structure
    should be read.
    If a \code{\link[base]{character}} string, it is interpreted as filename, which then
    will be opened (and closed afterwards).
    If a \code{\link[base]{raw}} \code{\link[base]{vector}}, it will be read via as a raw binary \code{\link[base:connections]{connection}}.
  }
  \item{maxLength}{The maximum number of bytes to be read from the input
    stream, which should be equal to the length of the MAT file structure.
    If \code{NULL}, data will be read until End Of File has been reached.}
  \item{fixNames}{If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}}, underscores within names of MATLAB variables
    and fields are converted to periods.}
  \item{drop}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} \code{\link[base]{vector}} specifying cases when one or more dimensions
    of elements should be dropped in order to decrease the amount of "nestedness"
    of the returned data structure.  This only applies to the MAT v5 file format.}
  \item{sparseMatrixClass}{If \code{"matrix"}, a sparse matrix is expanded to
    a regular \code{\link[base]{matrix}}.  If either \code{"Matrix"} (default) or \code{"SparseM"},
    the sparse matrix representation by the package of the same name will be used.
    These packages are only loaded if the a sparse matrix is read.}
  \item{verbose}{Either a \code{\link[base]{logical}}, a \code{\link[base]{numeric}}, or a \code{\link[R.utils]{Verbose}}
    object specifying how much verbose/debug information is written to
    standard output. If a Verbose object, how detailed the information is
    is specified by the threshold level of the object. If a numeric, the
    value is used to set the threshold of a new Verbose object. If \code{\link[base:logical]{TRUE}},
    the threshold is set to -1 (minimal). If \code{\link[base:logical]{FALSE}}, no output is written.
  }
  \item{...}{Not used.}
}

\value{
  Returns a named \code{\link[base]{list}} structure containing all variables in the
  MAT file structure.
}

\section{Speed performance}{
  This function uses a MAT file parser implemented completely using
  pure R. For MAT files containing large vectorized objects, for instance
  long vectors and large matrices, the R implementation is indeed fast
  enough because it can read and parse each such objects in one go.

  On the other hand, for MAT files containing a large number of small
  objects, e.g. a large number of cell structures, there will be a
  significant slowdown, because each of the small objects has to be
  parsed individually.
  In such cases, if possible, try to (re)save the data in MATLAB
  using larger ("more vectorized") objects.
}

\section{MAT cell structures}{
  For the MAT v5 format, \emph{cell} structures are read into
  \R as a \code{\link[base]{list}} structure.
}

\section{Unicode strings}{
 Recent versions of MATLAB store some strings using Unicode
 encodings.  If the R installation supports \code{\link{iconv}},
 these strings will be read correctly.  Otherwise non-ASCII codes
 are converted to NA.  Saving to an earlier file format version
 may avoid this problem as well.
}

\section{Reading compressed MAT files}{
 From MATLAB v7, \emph{compressed} MAT version 5 files are used by
 default [3-5], which is supported by this function.

 If for some reason it fails, use \code{save -V6} in MATLAB to write
 non-compressed MAT v5 files (sic!).
}

\section{About MAT files saved in MATLAB using '-v7.3'}{
 MAT v7.3 files, saved using for instance \code{save('foo.mat', '-v7.3')},
 stores the data in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) [6, 7], which
 is a format not supported by this function/package.
 However, there exist other R packages that can parse HDF5, e.g.
 CRAN package \pkg{h5} and Bioconductor package \pkg{rhdf5}.
}

\section{Reading MAT file structures input streams}{
 Reads a MAT file structure from an input stream, either until End of File
 is detected or until \code{maxLength} bytes has been read.
 Using \code{maxLength} it is possible to read MAT file structure over
 socket connections and other non-terminating input streams. In such cases
 the \code{maxLength} has to be communicated before sending the actual
 MAT file structure.

path <- system.file("mat-files", package = "R.matlab")
pathname <- file.path(path, "ABC.mat")
data <- readMat(pathname)
print(data)

  The internal MAT v4 reader was written by
  Andy Jacobson (Princeton University).
  Support for reading sparse matrices, UTF-encoded strings and
  compressed files, was contributed by Jason Riedy (UC Berkeley).
